- modify differentiability to also do differentiable_at
- do cont_differentiability in differentiability
- MAYBE: modify cont_diff to solve things in cont_diff as well as cont_diff_on
- think about a tactic to calculate derivatives 


WHY THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK
- machinery missing in mathlib. 
    - integrals defined on uIccs, but cont_diff gives continuous and differentiable on open sets within the set given
    - i have my own uIoo now but like .. ?
    - nothing about derivatives of abs - no idea how to prove this in mathlib
    - 
    - can't find the trick in mathlib to convert between composition of linear maps and smuls 
        there's a coe_mul but not coe_smul
- getting the composition in and out of the derivative and norms seems crazy hard 
    - so then can't apply change of variables correctly
- fderiv_deriv doesn't give the multiplication - need the linear map trick to prove this
- I think deriv_of_parametrisation may actually not be true ??? the way I've defined it at least
- more generally, the issues with open sets within stuff for integrability... either the geom cw notes are wrong
    or mathlib is doing something too strong and integrability should be on an open set
